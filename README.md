# üõ†Ô∏è VSCode Utilities

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides helpful utilities for code manipulation, editing, and navigation.

## ‚ú® Features

### üóëÔ∏è Code Scope Management

This extension provides powerful commands to work with code scopes:

- **Delete Current Function/Method/Class/Interface/Enum**: Delete the entire code unit that your cursor is currently in or on
- **Delete Current Bracket Scope**: Delete the content between the nearest curly brackets (preserving the brackets themselves)
- **Select Current Scope**: Select and copy the entire function, method, class, interface, or enum
- **Select Current Bracket Scope**: Select and copy the content between the nearest curly brackets

These features help you quickly clean up, refactor, or reuse code without having to manually select large blocks of text.

### üß≠ S-expression Navigation and Selection (Emacs-like)

The extension provides Emacs-like S-expression navigation, selection, and transposition commands with enhanced visual feedback:

#### Navigation Commands
- **Forward S-expression**: Navigate to the end of the next balanced expression
- **Backward S-expression**: Navigate to the beginning of the previous balanced expression

#### Selection Commands
- **Mark S-expression**: Select the current or next balanced expression
- **Mark Parent S-expression**: Select the parent expression that contains the current cursor position
- **Expand Selection to Parent S-expression**: Expand the current selection to include the parent expression

#### Transposition Commands
- **Transpose S-expressions**: Swap the current S-expression with the next one
- **Move S-expression Up**: Move the current S-expression up in a list (swap with previous sibling)
- **Move S-expression Down**: Move the current S-expression down in a list (swap with next sibling)

These features help programmers quickly navigate, manipulate, and restructure code by treating code as structured expressions (like Lisp S-expressions), jumping between balanced delimiters such as parentheses, brackets, and braces, as well as identifiers and literals.

The enhanced visual feedback system provides:
- Visual highlighting of the source and target positions
- Animated path visualization showing the navigation direction
- Automatic detection and display of expression types (array, object, string, etc.)
- Temporary status bar and notification messages with navigation details
- Customizable animation duration and visual effects

### üìä Status Bar Scope Indicator

The extension adds a status bar indicator that shows:

- The type and name of the current scope (function, class, interface, enum)
- Quick access to scope actions when clicked
- Visual indication of your current context in the code

## üîÑ How It Works

The extension intelligently:
- üîç Detects when your cursor is on or within a function/method/class/interface/enum
- üìç Identifies the complete scope of the code block with proper boundary detection
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Provides precise deletion or selection of just the content you want
- üß† Identifies balanced expressions for S-expression navigation and selection
- üöÄ Navigates efficiently through code using structural patterns
- üìã Automatically copies selected content to clipboard when configured
- üìã Automatically copies deleted or selected content to the clipboard (configurable)
- üîÜ Provides visual highlighting before deletion for confirmation (configurable)
- üéØ Renders enhanced visual feedback during S-expression navigation (configurable)

### Command Comparison

| Command | Target | Preserves | Use Case |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| `deleteCurrentScope` | Functions, Methods, Classes, etc. | Nothing | Complete removal of code units |
| `deleteCurrentBracketScope` | Content between `{ }` | Bracket pair | Clearing implementation while keeping structure |
| `selectCurrentScope` | Functions, Methods, Classes, etc. | Everything | Copy entire code units |
| `selectCurrentBracketScope` | Content between `{ }` | Everything | Copy implementation details |
| `forwardSexp` | Next balanced expression | Everything | Navigate to end of expression |
| `backwardSexp` | Previous balanced expression | Everything | Navigate to beginning of expression |
| `markSexp` | Current or next balanced expression | Everything | Select expression |
| `markParentSexp` | Parent expression of current cursor position | Everything | Select parent expression |
| `expandSelectionToParentSexp` | Current selection | Everything | Expand selection to parent expression |
| `transposeSexp` | Current and next S-expression | Everything | Swap S-expressions |
| `moveSexpUp` | Current S-expression | Everything | Move S-expression up in a list |
| `moveSexpDown` | Current S-expression | Everything | Move S-expression down in a list |

### üß© Supported Languages

These utilities work with:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python (for scope deletion/selection features)

Basic functionality should work in most languages that use curly braces or indentation-based code blocks.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Position your cursor on or within a function, method, class, interface, or enum
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
3. Run one of the following commands:
   - `Extension: Delete Current Scope`
   - `Extension: Delete Current Bracket Scope`
   - `Extension: Select Current Scope and Copy to Clipboard`
   - `Extension: Select Current Bracket Scope and Copy to Clipboard`
   - `Extension: Navigate to End of S-expression (Emacs-like Forward Sexp)`
   - `Extension: Navigate to Start of S-expression (Emacs-like Backward Sexp)`
   - `Extension: Mark S-expression`
   - `Extension: Mark Parent S-expression`
   - `Extension: Expand Selection to Parent S-expression`
   - `Extension: Transpose S-expressions`

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

For faster access, the extension provides the following keyboard shortcuts:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+k",
  "command": "extension.deleteCurrentScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+b",
  "command": "extension.deleteCurrentBracketScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+a",
  "command": "extension.selectCurrentScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+s",
  "command": "extension.selectCurrentBracketScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+f",
  "command": "extension.forwardSexp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+b",
  "command": "extension.backwardSexp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+m",
  "command": "extension.markSexp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+p",
  "command": "extension.markParentSexp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+e",
  "command": "extension.expandSelectionToParentSexp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{

The S-expression navigation commands use the familiar Emacs keybindings:
- `Ctrl+Alt+F` - Forward S-expression
- `Ctrl+Alt+B` - Backward S-expression
- `Ctrl+Alt+M` - Mark S-expression
- `Ctrl+Alt+P` - Mark Parent S-expression
- `Ctrl+Alt+E` - Expand Selection to Parent S-expression
- `Ctrl+Alt+T` - Transpose S-expressions
- `Ctrl+Alt+U` - Move S-expression Up
- `Ctrl+Alt+D` - Move S-expression Down

## üìã Requirements

- Visual Studio Code v1.54.0 or higher

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

This extension provides the following settings:

* `vscodeUtilities.highlightBeforeDeleting`: Toggle whether to highlight code before deletion and show a confirmation dialog (default: false)
