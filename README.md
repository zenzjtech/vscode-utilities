# üõ†Ô∏è VSCode Utilities

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides helpful utilities for code manipulation, editing, and navigation.

## ‚ú® Features

### üóëÔ∏è Code Scope Management

This extension provides powerful commands to work with code scopes:

- **Delete Current Function/Method/Class/Interface/Enum**: Delete the entire code unit that your cursor is currently in or on
- **Delete Current Bracket Scope**: Delete the content between the nearest curly brackets (preserving the brackets themselves)
- **Select Current Scope**: Select and copy the entire function, method, class, interface, or enum
- **Select Current Bracket Scope**: Select and copy the content between the nearest curly brackets

These features help you quickly clean up, refactor, or reuse code without having to manually select large blocks of text.

### üß≠ S-expression Navigation (Emacs-like)

The extension provides Emacs-like S-expression navigation commands:

- **Forward S-expression**: Navigate to the end of the next balanced expression
- **Backward S-expression**: Navigate to the beginning of the previous balanced expression

These features help programmers quickly navigate through code by treating code as structured expressions (like Lisp S-expressions), jumping between balanced delimiters such as parentheses, brackets, and braces, as well as identifiers and literals.

### üìä Status Bar Scope Indicator

The extension adds a status bar indicator that shows:

- The type and name of the current scope (function, class, interface, enum)
- Quick access to scope actions when clicked
- Visual indication of your current context in the code

## üîÑ How It Works

The extension intelligently:
- üîç Detects when your cursor is on or within a function/method/class/interface/enum
- üìç Identifies the complete scope of the code block with proper boundary detection
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Provides precise deletion or selection of just the content you want
- üß† Identifies balanced expressions for S-expression navigation
- üöÄ Navigates efficiently through code using structural patterns
- üìã Automatically copies deleted or selected content to the clipboard (configurable)
- üîÜ Provides visual highlighting before deletion for confirmation (configurable)

### Command Comparison

| Command | Target | Preserves | Use Case |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| `deleteCurrentScope` | Functions, Methods, Classes, etc. | Nothing | Complete removal of code units |
| `deleteCurrentBracketScope` | Content between `{ }` | Bracket pair | Clearing implementation while keeping structure |
| `selectCurrentScope` | Functions, Methods, Classes, etc. | Everything | Copy entire code units |
| `selectCurrentBracketScope` | Content between `{ }` | Everything | Copy implementation details |
| `forwardSexp` | Next balanced expression | Everything | Navigate to end of expression |
| `backwardSexp` | Previous balanced expression | Everything | Navigate to beginning of expression |

### üß© Supported Languages

These utilities work with:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python (for scope deletion/selection features)

Basic functionality should work in most languages that use curly braces or indentation-based code blocks.

## üìä Extension Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Position Cursor] --> B{On Definition Line?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Detect Function/Class]
    B -->|No| D{Inside Code Scope?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Find Containing Scope]
    D -->|No| F[No Action]
    C --> G[Delete/Select Complete Scope]
    E --> G
    
    H[Position Cursor] --> I{Near Brackets?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Find Bracket Pair]
    I -->|No| K[Try Next Bracket Pair]
    J --> L[Delete/Select Content Between Brackets]
    K --> L

    M[Position Cursor] --> N[S-expression Navigation]
    N -->|Forward| O[Find Next Expression End]
    N -->|Backward| P[Find Previous Expression Start]
    O --> Q[Move Cursor & Highlight]
    P --> Q
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Position your cursor on or within a function, method, class, interface, or enum
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
3. Run one of the following commands:
   - `Extension: Delete Current Scope`
   - `Extension: Delete Current Bracket Scope`
   - `Extension: Select Current Scope and Copy to Clipboard`
   - `Extension: Select Current Bracket Scope and Copy to Clipboard`
   - `Extension: Navigate to End of S-expression (Emacs-like Forward Sexp)`
   - `Extension: Navigate to Start of S-expression (Emacs-like Backward Sexp)`

4. Alternatively, use the status bar indicator to:
   - View your current scope context
   - Access scope actions via the quick menu
   - See scope type and name at a glance

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

For faster access, the extension provides the following keyboard shortcuts:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+k",
  "command": "extension.deleteCurrentScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+b",
  "command": "extension.deleteCurrentBracketScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+a",
  "command": "extension.selectCurrentScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+c ctrl+s",
  "command": "extension.selectCurrentBracketScope",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+f",
  "command": "extension.forwardSexp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+alt+b",
  "command": "extension.backwardSexp",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

The S-expression navigation commands use the familiar Emacs keybindings:
- `Ctrl+Alt+F` - Forward S-expression
- `Ctrl+Alt+B` - Backward S-expression

## üìã Requirements

- Visual Studio Code v1.54.0 or higher

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

This extension provides the following settings:

* `vscodeUtilities.highlightBeforeDeleting`: Toggle whether to highlight code before deletion and show a confirmation dialog (default: false)
* `vscodeUtilities.copyToClipboard`: Toggle whether to automatically copy deleted or selected content to the clipboard (default: true)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- In some complex code structures, scope detection might not work perfectly
- Detection works best with well-formatted code
- S-expression navigation is optimized for TypeScript/JavaScript and may have limitations in other languages
