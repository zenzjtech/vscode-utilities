# üõ†Ô∏è VSCode Utilities

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides helpful utilities for code manipulation, editing, and navigation.

## ‚ú® Features

### üóëÔ∏è Code Scope Management

This extension provides powerful commands to work with code scopes:

- **Delete Current Function/Method/Class/Interface/Enum**: Delete the entire code unit that your cursor is currently in or on
- **Delete Current Bracket Scope**: Delete the content between the nearest curly brackets (preserving the brackets themselves)
- **Select Current Scope**: Select and copy the entire function, method, class, interface, or enum
- **Select Current Bracket Scope**: Select and copy the content between the nearest curly brackets

These features help you quickly clean up, refactor, or reuse code without having to manually select large blocks of text.

### üß≠ S-expression Navigation and Selection (Emacs-like)

The extension provides Emacs-like S-expression navigation, selection, and transposition commands with enhanced visual feedback:

#### Navigation Commands
- **Forward S-expression**: Navigate to the end of the next balanced expression
- **Backward S-expression**: Navigate to the beginning of the previous balanced expression

#### Selection Commands
- **Mark S-expression**: Select the current or next balanced expression
- **Mark Parent S-expression**: Select the parent expression that contains the current cursor position
- **Expand Selection to Parent S-expression**: Expand the current selection to include the parent expression

#### Transposition Commands
- **Transpose S-expressions**: Swap the current S-expression with the next one
- **Move S-expression Up**: Move the current S-expression up in a list (swap with previous sibling)
- **Move S-expression Down**: Move the current S-expression down in a list (swap with next sibling)

These features help programmers quickly navigate, manipulate, and restructure code by treating code as structured expressions (like Lisp S-expressions), jumping between balanced delimiters such as parentheses, brackets, and braces, as well as identifiers and literals.

The enhanced visual feedback system provides:
- Visual highlighting of the source and target positions
- Animated path visualization showing the navigation direction
- Automatic detection and display of expression types (array, object, string, etc.)
- Temporary status bar and notification messages with navigation details
- Customizable animation duration and visual effects

### üß© Scope Navigation

The extension provides convenient commands to navigate between code structures in your document:

#### Function Navigation
- **Next Function**: Jump to the next function declaration in the document (`alt+down`)
- **Previous Function**: Jump to the previous function declaration in the document (`alt+up`)

#### Class Navigation
- **Next Class**: Jump to the next class declaration in the document (`alt+shift+down`)
- **Previous Class**: Jump to the previous class declaration in the document (`alt+shift+up`)

#### General Scope Navigation
- **Next Scope**: Jump to the next function or class declaration in the document (`alt+right`)
- **Previous Scope**: Jump to the previous function or class declaration in the document (`alt+left`)

These navigation features help you quickly move between important code structures without having to manually search or scroll through the document. When reaching the beginning or end of the document, navigation can optionally wrap around to the other end.

### üìä Status Bar Scope Indicator

The extension adds a status bar indicator that shows:

- The type and name of the current scope (function, class, interface, enum)
- Quick access to scope actions when clicked
- Visual indication of your current context in the code

## üîÑ How It Works

The extension intelligently:
- üîç Detects when your cursor is on or within a function/method/class/interface/enum
- üìç Identifies the complete scope of the code block with proper boundary detection
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Provides precise deletion or selection of just the content you want
- üß† Identifies balanced expressions for S-expression navigation and selection
- üöÄ Navigates efficiently through code using structural patterns
- üìã Automatically copies selected content to clipboard when configured
- üìã Automatically copies deleted or selected content to the clipboard (configurable)
- üîÜ Provides visual highlighting before deletion for confirmation (configurable)
- üéØ Renders enhanced visual feedback during S-expression navigation (configurable)

### üß© Supported Languages

These utilities work with:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python (for scope deletion/selection features)

Basic functionality should work in most languages that use curly braces or indentation-based code blocks.
