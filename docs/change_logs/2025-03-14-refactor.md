## S-expression Handler Refactoring

- Refactored the large `handlers.ts` file in the S-expression navigation feature into smaller, more focused modules:
  - Created a new `handlers` directory with the following structure:
    - `base-handler.ts`: Base abstract class with common utility methods shared across handlers
    - `navigation-handlers.ts`: Handlers for forward and backward S-expression navigation
    - `selection-handlers.ts`: Handlers for S-expression selection operations
    - `transposition-handlers.ts`: Handlers for S-expression transposition operations
    - `index.ts`: Consolidated exports and facade class to maintain backward compatibility

- Key improvements from this refactoring:
  - Improved code organization and maintainability by following the Single Responsibility Principle
  - Enhanced readability with smaller, focused modules
  - Provided better separation of concerns between different types of S-expression operations
  - Maintained backward compatibility through the facade pattern
  - Made future extensions and additions easier by establishing clear boundaries between functionality

- Technical details:
  - Created a `BaseSexpHandler` abstract class that contains common utility methods
  - Each handler type extends this base class to inherit common functionality
  - Added a facade class that delegates to the appropriate specialized handler
  - Ensured that all public APIs remain unchanged to prevent breaking existing code
