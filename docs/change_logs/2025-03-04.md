## Enhanced UI Features

**Developer:** AI Assistant

### Implemented Features
- Added scrollbar customization feature to make scrollbars thinner (50% of default) and rounder at the corners
- Created a toggle command to enable/disable the enhanced scrollbar feature
- Added state management to remember user preference for enhanced scrollbars
- Integrated with the "Custom CSS and JS Loader" extension for proper CSS injection
- Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation on how to use the feature

### Technical Implementation Details
1. Created a custom CSS definition for thinner scrollbars (8px width) with rounded corners (4px border-radius)
2. Added a command `ui-enhancer.enhanceScrollUI` to toggle the enhanced UI
3. Used VSCode's globalState API to persist user preference
4. Added comprehensive user instructions for installation and configuration

### Next Steps
- Add more UI enhancement options, such as custom editor colors or font styles
- Create a settings page for customizing the scrollbar width and corner radius
- Add direct integration without requiring the "Custom CSS and JS Loader" extension
