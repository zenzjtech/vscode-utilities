## Bracket Scope Selection Feature Implementation
- Added a new feature to select/highlight the current bracket scope and copy its content to clipboard
- Implemented `extension.selectCurrentBracketScope` command for selecting the current bracket scope

- Reused the existing bracket pair detection logic to ensure consistent behavior
- Enhanced user feedback with detailed information messages showing context, line range, and copy confirmation
- Implemented automatic scrolling to center the selected code in the editor view
- Used different message types (information/warning) for current or next bracket selections

## Scope Selection Feature Implementation
- Added a new feature to select/highlight the current scope (function, class, interface, or enum) and copy its content to clipboard
- Implemented `extension.selectCurrentScope` command for selecting the current scope
- Added keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C Ctrl+A` to quickly select and copy the content of the current scope
- Reused the existing scope detection logic to ensure consistent behavior
- Enhanced user feedback with detailed information messages showing scope name, line range, and copy confirmation
- Implemented automatic scrolling to center the selected code in the editor view
- Used different message types (information/warning) for different scope types (function, class, interface, enum)

## Status Bar Scope Indicator Implementation
- Added a status bar indicator that displays the current scope type and name
- Shows different icons for different scope types (function, class, interface, enum)
- Provides tooltip with detailed scope information including line number
- Implemented a quick-access menu for scope actions when clicking the indicator
- Added selection and deletion actions to the quick-access menu
- Implemented real-time updates as the cursor moves between different scopes
- Added debounced updates to prevent excessive processing during rapid cursor movements

## Clipboard Feature Implementation
- Implemented a feature to automatically copy deleted content to the clipboard for easy recovery or reuse in both Scope Deletion and Bracket Scope features

## S-expression Navigation Feature Implementation
- Implemented Emacs-like S-expression navigation with Forward and Backward navigation commands
- Created the `SexpNavigationFeature` module with the following components:
  - `types.ts`: Defined interfaces for S-expression boundaries and navigators
  - `finders/typescript-navigator.ts`: Implemented S-expression navigation for TypeScript/JavaScript
  - `finders/index.ts`: Created a factory for managing language-specific sexp navigators
  - `ui-utils.ts`: Added UI utilities for highlighting and feedback
  - `handlers.ts`: Implemented command handlers for forward and backward sexp navigation
- Added support for balanced expressions (parentheses, brackets, braces) and identifiers/keywords
- Implemented visual highlighting of the target expression for better user feedback
- Added keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+F` for forward S-expression navigation
  - `Ctrl+Alt+B` for backward S-expression navigation
- Updated documentation to describe the new S-expression navigation features
- Integrated the feature with the extension's modular architecture

## S-expression Navigation Visual Feedback Enhancement
- Implemented enhanced visual feedback for S-expression navigation to make it more intuitive and visually appealing

- Implemented automatic expression type detection (array, object, string, etc.) with informative status messages
- Created customizable animation duration and visual effects through new configuration options
- Added different highlighting styles for source and destination positions
- Implemented temporary notification messages with navigation details
- Added the following configuration settings:
  - `vscodeUtilities.enhancedSexpNavigationAnimation` (default: true) to toggle enhanced animations
  - `vscodeUtilities.sexpNavigationHighlightDuration` (default: 600ms) to control highlight duration
  - `vscodeUtilities.showExpressionTypeInStatusBar` (default: true) to toggle expression type display
- Updated the README.md to document these new features and settings
- Refactored the UI utilities and handler implementations for better maintainability

## S-expression Selection Commands Implementation
- Added new Emacs-like S-expression selection commands to the S-expression navigation feature
- Implemented the following new commands:
  - `extension.markSexp`: Selects the current or next balanced expression
  - `extension.markParentSexp`: Selects the parent expression that contains the cursor
  - `extension.expandSexpSelection`: Expands the current selection to include the parent expression
- Added parent expression detection with a size-based sorting algorithm to find the smallest valid parent
- Enhanced the UI feedback for selection operations with status bar messages
- Added optional automatic copying of selected expressions to the clipboard
- Implemented keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+M` for marking S-expressions
  - `Ctrl+Alt+P` for marking parent S-expressions
  - `Ctrl+Alt+E` for expanding selection to parent S-expressions
- Added detailed selection information (line count, character count) in status messages
- Leveraged the existing enhanced visual feedback system for consistent user experience
- Updated the README.md to document these new selection commands
- Integrated the new commands with the existing modular architecture

## Configuration Settings
- Added `vscodeUtilities.highlightBeforeDeleting` (default: false) to configure whether to highlight code before deletion
- Added `vscodeUtilities.copyToClipboard` (default: true) to configure whether deleted content is automatically copied to clipboard
- Added `vscodeUtilities.enhancedSexpNavigationAnimation` (default: true) to toggle enhanced S-expression navigation animations
- Added `vscodeUtilities.sexpNavigationHighlightDuration` (default: 600ms) to customize the duration of highlight effects
- Added `vscodeUtilities.showExpressionTypeInStatusBar` (default: true) to toggle showing expression type information
- These settings apply to both scope-related features and S-expression navigation features
