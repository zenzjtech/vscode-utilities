# Change Log: 2025-03-14

## Documentation Enhancements
- Created a comprehensive architecture document (`/docs/architecture.md`) outlining a new modular and extensible design for the VS Code extension
- Detailed the proposed architecture with core components, directory structure, and implementation examples
- Enhanced the documentation with visual elements:
  - Added descriptive icons throughout the document
  - Created Mermaid diagrams for System Architecture Flow and Feature Command Flow
  - Implemented formatted tables for Benefits, Implementation Roadmap, and Design Patterns

## Architecture Implementation
- Designed a module-based architecture with Strategy Pattern for language providers
- Created a clear separation between language-specific logic and feature implementations
- Outlined a dependency injection system for service management
- Proposed a feature module system for organizing functionality
- Established a roadmap for refactoring the existing codebase

## Core Command Registry Implementation
- Created the core directory structure for the new modular architecture
- Implemented the `CommandRegistry` class in `/src/core/command-registry.ts` for central command registration and management
- Created a lightweight dependency injection container (`ServiceContainer`) in `/src/core/container.ts`
- Implemented the abstract `FeatureModule` base class in `/src/core/feature-module.ts` to standardize feature implementation
- Refactored existing functionality into two feature modules:
  - `ScopeDeletionFeature`: Handles the deletion of functions, methods, and classes
  - `BracketScopeFeature`: Provides functionality to delete content between bracket pairs
- Updated the main extension entry point to use the new modular architecture
- Added backward compatibility wrappers to ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture

## Scope Deletion Feature Enhancements
- Enhanced notification messages to include scope name and number of lines removed
- Added support for TypeScript interfaces and enums in addition to functions and classes
- Implemented visual scope highlighting before deletion to preview affected code
- Added confirmation dialogs with detailed information about what will be deleted
- Used different message types with icons for various scope types (function, class, interface, enum)
- Improved detection of scope boundaries with more robust regex patterns
- Added a configuration setting `vscodeUtilities.highlightBeforeDeleting` to toggle the highlighting feature (default: false)
- Added keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C Ctrl+K` to quickly delete the current scope
- Implemented automatic copying of deleted content to the clipboard for easy recovery or reuse

## Bracket Scope Feature Improvements
- Fixed the bracket scope deletion feature to handle undefined position parameters
- Enhanced notification messages to show context, line range, and number of lines affected
- Added highlighting preview for bracket content before deletion
- Implemented confirmation dialog with detailed information about what will be deleted
- Added extraction of context information from surrounding code to improve user feedback
- Made the highlighting feature configurable through the same setting used for scope deletion
- Added keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C Ctrl+B` to quickly delete content within current brackets
- Implemented automatic copying of deleted content to the clipboard for easy recovery or reuse

## Bracket Scope Selection Feature Implementation
- Added a new feature to select/highlight the current bracket scope and copy its content to clipboard
- Implemented `extension.selectCurrentBracketScope` command for selecting the current bracket scope
- Added keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C Ctrl+S` to quickly select and copy the content within current brackets
- Reused the existing bracket pair detection logic to ensure consistent behavior
- Enhanced user feedback with detailed information messages showing context, line range, and copy confirmation
- Implemented automatic scrolling to center the selected code in the editor view
- Used different message types (information/warning) for current or next bracket selections

## Scope Selection Feature Implementation
- Added a new feature to select/highlight the current scope (function, class, interface, or enum) and copy its content to clipboard
- Implemented `extension.selectCurrentScope` command for selecting the current scope
- Added keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C Ctrl+A` to quickly select and copy the content of the current scope
- Reused the existing scope detection logic to ensure consistent behavior
- Enhanced user feedback with detailed information messages showing scope name, line range, and copy confirmation
- Implemented automatic scrolling to center the selected code in the editor view
- Used different message types (information/warning) for different scope types (function, class, interface, enum)

## Status Bar Scope Indicator Implementation
- Added a status bar indicator that displays the current scope type and name
- Shows different icons for different scope types (function, class, interface, enum)
- Provides tooltip with detailed scope information including line number
- Implemented a quick-access menu for scope actions when clicking the indicator
- Added selection and deletion actions to the quick-access menu
- Implemented real-time updates as the cursor moves between different scopes
- Added debounced updates to prevent excessive processing during rapid cursor movements

## Clipboard Feature Implementation
- Implemented a feature to automatically copy deleted content to the clipboard for easy recovery or reuse in both Scope Deletion and Bracket Scope features

## Configuration Settings
- Added `vscodeUtilities.highlightBeforeDeleting` (default: false) to configure whether to highlight code before deletion
- Added `vscodeUtilities.copyToClipboard` (default: true) to configure whether deleted content is automatically copied to clipboard
- Both settings apply to both scope deletion and bracket scope deletion features
