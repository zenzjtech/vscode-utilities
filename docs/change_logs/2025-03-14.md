# Change Log: 2025-03-14

## Documentation Enhancements
- Created a comprehensive architecture document (`/docs/architecture.md`) outlining a new modular and extensible design for the VS Code extension
- Detailed the proposed architecture with core components, directory structure, and implementation examples
- Enhanced the documentation with visual elements:
  - Added descriptive icons throughout the document
  - Created Mermaid diagrams for System Architecture Flow and Feature Command Flow
  - Implemented formatted tables for Benefits, Implementation Roadmap, and Design Patterns

## Architecture Implementation
- Designed a module-based architecture with Strategy Pattern for language providers
- Created a clear separation between language-specific logic and feature implementations
- Outlined a dependency injection system for service management
- Proposed a feature module system for organizing functionality
- Established a roadmap for refactoring the existing codebase

## Core Command Registry Implementation
- Created the core directory structure for the new modular architecture
- Implemented the `CommandRegistry` class in `/src/core/command-registry.ts` for central command registration and management
- Created a lightweight dependency injection container (`ServiceContainer`) in `/src/core/container.ts`
- Implemented the abstract `FeatureModule` base class in `/src/core/feature-module.ts` to standardize feature implementation
- Refactored existing functionality into two feature modules:
  - `ScopeDeletionFeature`: Handles the deletion of functions, methods, and classes
  - `BracketScopeFeature`: Provides functionality to delete content between bracket pairs
- Updated the main extension entry point to use the new modular architecture
- Added backward compatibility wrappers to ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture
